# number-guessing-game
In this assignment you will create a simple number guessing game. The game will be played as follows. The computer will "think" of a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it. Each time the user makes a guess the computer will report if the guess is too high, too low or correct and finally print the number of guesses it took the user to guess the correct number.

The output of the program should look like this:

```
The computer has the secret number...
Enter your guess (1-100): 50
Too low... Try again.
Enter your guess (1-100): 100
Too high... Try again.
Enter your guess (1-100): 111
Bad guess. Please re-enter: -67
Bad guess. Please re-enter: 67
Too low... Try again.
Enter your guess (1-100): 68
Correct!
You used 4 guesses.
```
Note how "bad guesses" are not counted towards the number of guesses.
